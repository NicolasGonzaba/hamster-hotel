Challenge #2 - Hamster Hotel 

I took the template for the front page of hotel website and no only recreated it in HTML but also made it responsive to tablet and mobile sizes

Peer Review: Isaias Gonzalez - The "Our Rooms" section has slightly weird card sizing for the lg and xl breakpoints, and kinda breaks for the xs and sm breakpoints. The "Reserve a room" section has slightly weird form field sizing for the lg and xl breakpoints. All the other sections look great at all breakpoints. Nice work.
